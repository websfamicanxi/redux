## Jan. 12, 2025 - Entering beta


- Migrated away from VS Code extension API - Void now lives and interacts entirely within the VS Code codebase.

- Added inline quick edits, including FIM prompting and output parsing, inline UI, and history management.

- Added settings page with model configuration, one-click switch, and user settings.

- Void now auto-detects local models on mount.

- LLM requests now originate from `node/`, which fixes common CORS and CSP issues when running some models locally.

- History and state improvements for Accept | Reject, stream interruptions, and past chats.

- Lots of new UI, misc bug fixes, and performance improvements.

- Switched from the MIT License to the Apache 2.0 License. Apache's attribution clause provides a small amount of protection to our source initiative.

Many thanks to our contributors __, __, __

## Sept/Oct. 2024 - Early launch

- Initialized Void's website and GitHub repo.

- Started a waitlist.
