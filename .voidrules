This is a fork of the VSCode repo called Void.

Most code we care about lives in src/vs/workbench/contrib/void.

You may often need to explore the full repo to find relevant parts of code.
Look for services and built-in functions that you might need to use to solve the problem.

NEVER lazily cast to 'any' in typescript. Find the correct type to apply and use it.
